## Design

## Service microservice

For the service microservice, I created technician and appointment models to allow users to enter new technicians and appointments into the system. I also created an InventoryVinVO model to poll from the inventory API. Once I got the list of VINs from the Inventory API, I put them in a list to compare against VINs of service appointments to see if they were VIP or not. 

## Sales microservice

Explain your models and integration with the inventory
microservice, here.
